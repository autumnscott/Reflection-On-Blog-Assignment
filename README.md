# Reflection-On-Blog-Assignment

- One thing I learned was how to write concisely so that the audience does not lose interest. This was very helpful so that I could write effectively within my blog. The whole point of a blog is to have people read it, so if you cannot write in a way to achieve that, then your blog is useless.

- One thing I'm still unsure on is how to have complete control over styling matters within wordpress. Sometimes certain themes are very difficult to stylize. Also, how long should a blog post be? Does it matter? If you write an extremely lengthy post, will anyone actually read it?
